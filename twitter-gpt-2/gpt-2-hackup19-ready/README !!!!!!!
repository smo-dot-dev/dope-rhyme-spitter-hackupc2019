forest
Walking through the  I saw a mushroom

And in the midst, a green-mantled mushroom-tod,
A small, neat, shining plant; and in the sheaf,
I saw a little golden ear-marks, mark'd with care,
Printed for Those who would die for it.  And when,
As I approach'd its verdure, I saw the field,--
The very reaped-up harvest,--this is the page,
The very seed-song of the green-mantled May!
The fields,--the very clover,--the trees,--the flowers,
The golden-crested May-time, and the breeze,--
The trees,--the grass,--the sun,--the air,--the clouds,
A moment, and then vanish quite away!
And I remember, as I wander'd by,
The very little rain-drops drop by drop,
In the cool grass, for the first time, I thought,
"I'll take the dry pencil, Dear, you will!"
And I, who read, felt the cool furrow,
And the green past, with its waving forest leaves,
And thought it over.  Then, a slow, sweet smile
Came from the blue eyes of the dying day,
